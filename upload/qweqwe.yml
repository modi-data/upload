# The summary should contain a thorough description of the study design and execution.
# The description must be complete and self-contained, but can contain links
# to images and further information (but keep in mind that the description
# must make sense even if those links should stop working.)
# Multiline strings can be written by starting the value with a pipe symbol (|).
summary:

  why_was_it_collected: |
    Volunteers were recruited in the Trondheim area. Their vehicles got an OBU that
    recorded their GNSS position and speed every second, as well as displaying a map with
    the various geo-fence zones and their pricing.

  how_was_the_collection_executed: |
    Learn how road user charging together with geo-fencing was accepted by participants
    and investigate the readiness of the technology

  objectives: |
    Would there be a change in behaviour as a result of the system? Is GNSS based road
    user charging practically possible for personal vehicles from an OBU perspective? Is
    there acceptance for such a solution?

  research_questions: |
    The experiment was conducted for approximately two months, with different start ups
    and endings for all participants over a monthly period. In addition one pre-survey
    and one post-survey was conducted to capture acceptence data (not in this data set).
    The first two weeks, data was collected without showing the user any road charging or
    geo-fence information. These data were used as a baseline for driver behaviour.

  experimental_plan: |
    Drivers license required, living in or near the Trondheim area, and volunteering for
    the experiment.

# 5.3.1 Descriptive metadata
# "Descriptive metadata shall include detailed information needed to understand each part of a
# dataset. The purpose is to describe the dataset and build trust in it—by providing not only the
# characteristics of each measure or component, but also information about how the data were
# generated and collected."
descriptive:

    # The descriptions can vary by data type.
    # For each data field in your dataset, please fill out all relevant parameters from section
    # 5.3.1 of the DSF, and enter the attributes using the "Data description item" in lower-case
    # as the key. The following list lists the most relevant attributes from the tables, see 
    # tables 3 to 9 in the DSF for full explanations.
    
    # - description
    # - data_precision
    # - unit
    # - sample_rate
    # - filter
    # - origin
    # - bias
    # - type
    # - definition
    # - range

    # - time_zone (for time stamps)
    # - time_format (for time stamps)

    # Please note the following additions to the DSF:
    # - When dealing with coordinates, the SRID must be specified with the srid key.
    # - When dealing with times, the time zone must be specified with the timezone key.
    # - When dealing with dates or times, the format must be specified with the format key.
