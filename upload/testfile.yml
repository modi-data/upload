summary:

  why_was_it_collected: |
    To test if geo-fence zones with varying pricing could change the driving pattern
    of a group of test persons.

  how_was_the_collection_executed: |
    Volunteers were recruited in the Trondheim area. Their vehicles got an OBU that
    recorded their GNSS position and speed every second, as well as displaying a 
    map with the various geo-fence zones and their pricing.

  objectives: |
    Learn how road user charging together with geo-fencing was accepted by participants
    and investigate the readiness of the technology

  research_questions: |
    Would there be a change in behaviour as a result of the system? Is GNSS based road 
    user charging practically possible for personal vehicles from an OBU perspective? 
    Is there acceptance for such a solution?

  experimental_plan: |
    The experiment was conducted for approximately two months, with different start ups
    and endings for all participants over a monthly period. In addition one pre-survey
    and one post-survey was conducted to capture acceptence data (not in this data set).
    The first two weeks, data was collected without showing the user any road charging or
    geo-fence information. These data were used as a baseline for driver behaviour.

  sample_selection_criteria: |
    Drivers license required, living in or near the Trondheim area, and volunteering
    for the experiment.

# 5.3.3 Administrative metadata
# "Administrative metadata are collected for the effective operation and management of data
# storage and catalogues. This administrative information, covering various topics, is stored
# along with the datasets. From a FOT data re-use perspective, the key role of administrative
# metadata is to cover access conditions, rights, ownership and constraints."
administrative:

  # The version number of this dataset, used to keep track of different
  # versions if it is uploaded multiple times.
  # The version number can be numeric, date-based, or anything else, but
  # it must be easy to see which version is newer without further knowledge.
  version_number: 1

  # The date this dataset was uploaded. Must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  archiving_date: 2023-06-02

  # A unique identifier for this dataset. This will be used to identify this and
  # future updates in the metadata database, and must never be changed after the
  # dataset has been uploaded for the first time.

    Can not be presented anywhere in raw form, only after enough aggregation to anonymize
    each driver sufficiently.
  
  # Can the dataset be used for free, or does usage incur any costs/billing for the user?
  billing: The dataset can be used without cost as long as access and constraints are agreed upon.

  # This should include information about relevant conditions during the data collection
  # (for example weather, climate, time of day, etc).
  # Each key under "processes" can be custom made, and there can be as many as is
  # necessary. The proposed keys are just examples.
  processes:
    collection_preparation: |
      Volunteers were recruited through targeted social media ads and e-mails to relevant
      people or groups. Each volunteer got an OBU mounted in their vehicle.
    collection: |
      The OBUs mounted in the volunteer's vehicles collected data from the first day they
      were operational. For the first two weeks, the OBUs collected data silently, without
      giving the driver any information at all. These data are used as a baseline for driver
      behaviour.
      For the next 6 weeks, the OBUs HMI interface was active, and drivers were informed about
      road pricing zones and costs.
    anonymization: |
      All data are identified with the serial number of the OBU, and has no direct connection
      to the drivers. No further anonymization has been performed.
    processing: |
      Data was collected by the OBUs in each vehicle, and stored locally. Each time the unit
      was turned on, it would upload previously collected data.
    filtering: |
      This data set is the raw data, and has no filters.
    aggregation: |
      This data set is the raw data, and has no aggregations.

# 5.3.2 Structural metadata
# "Structural metadata are used to describe how the data are structured in relation to other
# data. Data are organized into a system (e.g., a database and/or file system), a structure or
# database schema and a data content format. The aim of structural metadata is to facilitate
# the initial phase of data re-use by providing the necessary documentation about how the data
# is organized. The description should include the file system, the file structure and how to
# interpret the contents of a data container. All components of the dataset need to be
# described."

  summary: |
    Each trip was recorded as a separate CSV file. Rows in the CSV file may not always contain 
    all columns, the event_type column tells which other columns can be expected for that row.

  # File format. Please include attributes such as delimiter for CSV, decimal separator, 
  # thousand separator (if any), and any other properties that is relevant for parsing the data.
  file_format: csv with ';' as delimiter, ',' as decimal separator.

  # Please describe the storage structure of the data. If it consists of flat files, the folder
  # structure and file naming can be relevant. If it is a database, a description of the relevant 
  # tables, indices, triggers and views is important.
  file_structure: flat files in a single folder, file names consists of [OBU ID]_[date-time start of trip].csv

  # Which tools can be used to read the data. Especially important for non-standard formats.
  required_tools: notepad, various CSV parsing libraries

  # If the files were made using a specific tool, the tool name and version may be relevant
  # for reading the data.

# characteristics of each measure or component, but also information about how the data were
# generated and collected."
